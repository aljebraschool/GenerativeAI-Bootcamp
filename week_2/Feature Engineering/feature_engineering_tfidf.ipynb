    "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a numerical statistic that measures how important a word is to a document within a collection of documents. \n",

    "Simple Analogy:\n",
    "Imagine you're analyzing book reviews. The word \"book\" appears in every review (not unique), but \"terrible\" appears frequently in negative reviews and rarely in positive ones. TF-IDF gives \"terrible\" a high score in negative reviews because it's both frequent there and rare elsewhere.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Term Frequency (TF): How often a word appears in a specific document\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"amazing\" appears 5 times in Review A\n",
    "\n",
    "- Higher TF = more relevant to that document\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- \"amazing\" appears in only 2% of all reviews\n",

    "- Word: \"cinematography\"\n",

    "\n",
    "- Word: \"movie\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - High TF in many reviews\n",
    "\n",
